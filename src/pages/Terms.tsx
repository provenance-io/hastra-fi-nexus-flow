                      <li>Lock up USDC (a U.S. dollarâ€“backed stablecoin);</li>
                      <li>
                        Receive in return a Solana-based token, sPRIME,
                        representing a claim against fully collateralized assets
                        held by Hastra.

                    <p>
                      The sPRIME token is backed 1:1 by YLDS, a yield-bearing
                      stablecoin issued by Figure and registered with the U.S.
                      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Hastra holds
                      YLDS as collateral for sPRIME, but does not issue YLDS and
                      makes no representations or warranties whatsoever
                      regarding the nature, risk profile, regulatory status, or

                      2A. Yield Mechanism
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Holders of sPRIME may accrue yield over time, which is
                      distributed based on the underlying performance of the
                      collateralized YLDS tokens. Yield is accumulated and held
                      in a designated smart contract. Users who wish to claim
                      their yield must:

                      <li>
                        Follow on-screen prompts to initiate a claim
                        transaction.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Any claim may be subject to fees, including network gas
                      fees and a Protocol fee, which will be disclosed at the
                      time of claim. Hastra does not guarantee the amount,
                      timing, or consistency of yield distributions. Yields are
                      variable and may fluctuate based on market conditions or
                      the performance of YLDS. You acknowledge and agree that
                      you are solely responsible for monitoring and claiming
                      your eligible yield and that unclaimed yield may not
                      accrue indefinitely.

                      While Hastra facilitates the exchange of USDC for sPRIME

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      By accessing and using the Site, you represent and warrant
                      that you understand the inherent risks associated with
                      using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that
                      you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies
                      of digital assets. You further understand that the markets
                      for digital assets are highly volatile due to various
                      factors, including adoption, speculation, technology,
                      security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that
                      the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
                      blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase
                      dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and
                      accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or
                      all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol
                      through the interface, you may suffer loss due to the
                      fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or
                      liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes,
                      experience significant price slippage and cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You understand that anyone can create a token, including
                      fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely
                      claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept
                      the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other
                      tokens. You further acknowledge that Hastra is not
                      responsible for any of these variables or risks, and
                      cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you
                      experience while accessing or using the service.
                      Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full
                      responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using
                      the Site.

                      Without limiting the foregoing, you also understand that
                      there may be tax and regulatory risks related to using the
                      Site or engaging with the Protocol. It is your sole
                      responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent,
                      any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct in
                      connection with your use of the service, and to withhold,
                      collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to
                      the appropriate tax authorities. Digital assets,
                      blockchain technology, and any related software and
                      services are also subject to legal and regulatory
                      uncertainty. You also understand that legislative and
                      regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the
                      usage, transferability, transactability and accessibility

                    <p>
                      You expressly agree that you assume all risks in
                      connection with your access and use of the Site. You
                      further expressly waive and release us from any and all
                      liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising
                      from or in any way relating to your use of the Site,
                      including your interaction with the Protocol. You will
                      indemnify and hold Hastra and its officers, directors,
                      employees, and agents, harmless from and against any
                      claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses,
                      and costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
                      reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in
                      any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the
                      Site, including any interactions with the Protocol through
                      the Site, (b) your violation of these Terms, or (c) your
                      violation of any rights of another. Hastra will provide
                      notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding.

                    <p>
                      Hastra reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense
                      and control of any matter which is subject to
                      indemnification under this section, and you agree to
                      cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Hastra's
                      defense of such matter. You may not settle or compromise
                      any claim against Hastra, its subsidiaries or affiliates
                      without the Hastra's prior written consent.
